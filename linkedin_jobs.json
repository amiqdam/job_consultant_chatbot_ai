    "description": "Atomic Machines is ushering in a new era of micromanufacturing with its Matter Compiler™ technology platform. This platform enables new classes of micromachines to be designed and built by providing manufacturing processes and a materials library that are inaccessible to semiconductor manufacturing methods. It unlocks MEMS manufacturing not only for device classes that could never be produced by semiconductor methods, but also for entirely new categories. Furthermore, this digital platform is fully programmable in the way 3D printing is digital—but whereas 3D printing produces parts of a single material using a single process, the Matter Compiler™ technology platform is a multi-process, multi-material system: bits and raw materials go in, and complete, functional micromachines come out. The Atomic Machines team has also created an exciting first device—made possible only through the Matter Compiler™ technology platform—that we will be unveiling to the world soon.\nOur offices are in Emeryville and Santa Clara, California.\nAbout The Role:\nWe are seeking a highly skilled Staff Mechanical Engineer to shape the foundation of our groundbreaking robotic manufacturing platform. In this role, you will work at the cutting edge of precision manipulation, designing critical subsystems that enable the assembly of microscopic parts with unparalleled accuracy.\nThis is an opportunity to work closely with cross-functional teams early in the product development cycle, collaborating with experts in mechanical design, electrical engineering, vision systems, robotics controls, and manufacturing engineering. You will be part of a fast-paced, hands-on environment, gaining deep multidisciplinary experience while directly influencing the future of scalable, high-precision automation.\nIf you're excited about pushing the boundaries of robotics and eager to have a high-impact role in an early-stage startup, we’d love to hear from you!\nWhat You’ll Do:\nDesign and develop mechanisms, end effectors, robotic axes, and systems that fit into a modular, complex robotic manufacturing platform.\nSubject designs and prototypes to rigorous testing that verifies performance down to the sub-micron level at statistically significant levels.\nWork cross-functionally on complex sub-systems of our automated fabrication platform to develop control algorithms, machine vision approaches, and closed-loop inspection and metrology functionalities.\nCreate CAD models of parts and assemblies, BOMs (bill of materials), detailed drawings, and technical design documentation.\nWork collaboratively using PDM and PLM systems, project management tools, and G-Suite tools.\nGet hands-on with your designs, driving your work to completion with fabrication and assembly efforts leveraging our in-house lab and machine shop.\nWhat You’ll Need:\nA first-principles mindset — you question assumptions, reframe problems from the ground up, and approach challenges with a foundational understanding rather than relying solely on precedent.\n7–10 years of relevant industry experience, including the design of electromechanical axes (bearing selection, actuator specification, and encoder selection).\nExpertise in mechanical design principles, engineering fundamentals, and significant experience with CAD tools for detailed drafting and modeling.\nExperience with precision engineering fundamentals.\nSelf-guided learner with the ability to rapidly ascend learning curves with minimal direction. While the HW Platform team includes highly experienced engineers, success in this role requires curiosity, initiative, and adaptability.\nReceptive to feedback from multiple sources and able to quickly adjust approach based on input. The ideal candidate actively seeks feedback—both from colleagues and hands-on experimentation.\nTeam-oriented mindset with a focus on collective success. Willingness to take on varied tasks, including less glamorous but necessary work, to drive the team forward.\nMaker mentality – A strong hands-on background in fabrication, machining, and prototyping is highly valued. While CAM and CNC machining proficiency are preferred, an intuitive understanding of materials and manufacturing processes is essential.\nStrong written and verbal communication skills, including the ability to clearly convey complex technical ideas and document designs effectively.\nProactive and self-driven – A self-starter who takes initiative and follows through to completion.\nMinimum B.S. in Mechanical Engineering (or equivalent experience).\nBonus Points For:\nExperience with high vacuum systems, airlocks and load locks.\nExperience with laser and optical systems.\nThe compensation for this position also includes equity and benefits.\nCA Bay Area Salary Range: $150,000 USD - $180,000 USD",
